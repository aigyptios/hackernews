A little React.js application that consumes the endpoints of Y Combinator's [HackerNews API](https://github.com/HackerNews/API).

This app was created with the [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) tool.

All of the React components are in `/components`, aside from `App.js`.

The `NewsViewer` component is not used. I kept it here because I'm lazy.
